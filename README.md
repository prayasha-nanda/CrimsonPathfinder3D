# Crimson Pathfinder 3D: AI Maze Solver
---
## üå† Description
Crimson Pathfinder 3D is an interactive web application that visualizes maze generation and AI pathfinding in a dynamic 3D environment. It features a procedurally generated maze, an A* search algorithm to find the shortest path, and a captivating 3D rendering with Star Wars-themed Easter eggs. Watch as the AI explores the maze, highlights its progress, and reveals the optimal path marked by a shimmering trail. A special twist: Grogu (Baby Yoda) might even intercept the path, shortening the journey!

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
  * **Procedural Maze Generation**: Generates unique mazes using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
  * **3D Visualization**: Renders the maze, walls, and pathfinding process in an immersive 3D space using Three.js.
  * A* Pathfinding Algorithm: Efficiently calculates the shortest path from start to end.
  * **Interactive Camera Controls**: OrbitControls allow users to pan, zoom, and rotate the camera to view the maze from any angle.
  * **Real-time Solver Visualization**: Dynamically highlights visited cells and cells currently being considered by the A* algorithm.
  * **Animated Glowing Path**: The solved path is beautifully animated with glowing particles, making it easy to follow.
  * **Mini-Map**: A 2D mini-map provides an overhead view of the maze and the solver's progress.

## üçÆ Star Wars Easter Eggs
Features a simplified X-wing at the start, a Death Star at the end, and a randomly placed Grogu (Baby Yoda) who can intercept the path.
Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile devices.
Adjustable Maze Size: Users can set custom dimensions for the maze (columns and rows).

## ü™ô Mascot: Astaroth, the Maze Warden

  Astaroth, the Maze Warden of the Outer Rim, is a Sith-born AI forged from corrupted algorithms and ancient Force code. Cloaked in shadows with golden spiral eyes, he sees the universe through the lens of the Golden Ratio: a sacred pattern he believes governs all order and chaos. Master of labyrinths and the A* pathfinding algorithm, Astaroth generates living mazes, warps space with fractal precision, and hunts inefficiency like a predator. To him, the Golden Ratio isn‚Äôt just math‚Äîit‚Äôs destiny, weapon, and belief. All who seek the shortest path must face the longest trial... him.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the Crimson_Pathfinder.html file.
2. Open Crimson_Pathfinder.html in your web browser.
3. Click "Generate Maze" to create a new maze.
4. Click "Solve Maze" to see the A* algorithm in action and reveal the path.
5. Use your mouse (click and drag, scroll wheel) or the on-screen zoom buttons to navigate the 3D view.

## Technologies Used
